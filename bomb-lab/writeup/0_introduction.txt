Introduction
------------

The binary bomb lab is a reverse engineering challenge where we have to
"defuse" a bomb by supplying the correct input.


Preliminary Study
-----------------

There are 2 ways to execute the bomb.
1. Provide the input via stdin.
2. Provide a file containing the input as argument.

Upon running the binary, the following output is produced:

Welcome to my fiendish little bomb. You have 6 phases with
which to blow yourself up. Have a nice day!


We have to defuse 6 phases and a bonus secret phase. Let's begin!
