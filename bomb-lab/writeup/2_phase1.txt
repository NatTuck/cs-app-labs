Phase 1
=======

In phase 1, a string is read and passed to the function phase_1. This argument
and string "Public speaking is very easy." are passed to strings_not_equal().
If string_not_equal() returns 0, then the bomb doesn't explode.

Intuitively, enter the string "Public speaking is very easy."

Welcome to my fiendish little bomb. You have 6 phases with
which to blow yourself up. Have a nice day!
Public speaking is very easy.
Phase 1 defused. How about the next one?

and phase 1 is defused! Great! Let's proceed to the next phase.

PS: Add "Public speaking is very easy." to a file say ans before continuing.
